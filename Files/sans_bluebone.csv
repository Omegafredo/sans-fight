im not making this pull request to request an actual attack, because youre WAY better at coding than ill ever be, but i came to say i just found this and its seriously amazing. every like once a month ill look at the all the knew copies of the sans fight mod to see if any are good, and WOW. this is amazing. i used to make mods as well, but ive deleted all of them because they were old and bad, and as someone who used to do the same, i have alot of respect for the effort in this. the sprites are so well done, the attacks are hard and theres even orange, and the intro actually caught me off guard because i expected more diolauge. i hope this blows up and merg plays it or something, because you really deserve it. i was one of the few people who worked on the jotaro sans simulator back when it was still up, and if that got popular, this should too.
